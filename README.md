# Slideshow
Just a simple slideshow.

1. Unzip the files
2. Navigate to the first folder
3. Open the executable
4. choose the folder with the images you want to slideshow. 

That's it! I'd be happy to add options on top if there is interest. My immediate thoughts are a speed control of some sort and
a choice between a consecutive loop or shuffle(currently shuffle only).
